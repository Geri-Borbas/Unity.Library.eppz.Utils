	+ Sets each given `GameObject` active on awake.

* [`ExecutionOrder/ExecutionOrder.cs`](ExecutionOrder/ExecutionOrder.cs)

	+ Adds attributes like `[ExecutionOrder(500)]` to have your script execution order managed explicitly. `Editor/ExecutionOrders` is process every class when it is loaded.

* [`Editor/ClipSurgery.cs`](Editor/CodeStats.cs)

	+ Animation tool to fix broken paths, remap animation targets / properties, copy keyframe tangents, or even copy entire animation curves (work-in). Goes to `Window/eppz!/Clip Surgery`.

* [`Editor/CodeStats.cs`](Editor/CodeStats.cs)

	+ Basic code statistics (line number / statement count distribution). Goes to `Window/eppz!/Code Stats`.

* [`Editor/HandTool.cs`](Editor/HandTool.cs)

* [`Editor/SliceRenamer.cs`](Editor/SliceRenamer.cs)

	+ Convenient tool to rename slices in your *Sprite Sheet* assets. Goes to `Window/eppz!/Select by Layer`.
	+ Also contains one of my favourite invention: a very interesting class `EmbeddedImage`, that allows you to store `Texture2D` images right in the C# source code (encoded to Base64 string), and access / decode it at runtime. Really convenient to package *Editor Tool* textures into a single file.

* [`Editor/Snap.cs`](Editor/Snap.cs)

	+ Some helper to snap your `GameObject` transform positions in *Editor*. Menu items goes to `eppz!/Snap` (see keyboard shortcuts beside menu items).
